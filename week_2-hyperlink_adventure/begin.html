        <h1>Brief & Endless Doorways</h1>
    
        <div class="door">
            <p> I stare into an infinitely  expanding and contracting portal. 
                <span><a class = "door" id="1" href="./doors/door1.html">Doors</a></span> constantly appearing and disappearing as I stare into its gaping maw. 
                I inch forward, the portal seems to quicken in anticipation, ready to swallow me whole. 
                Each new <span><a class = "door" id="2" href="./doors/door2.html">door</a></span> bring with it an echo, a sensation I can feel in the back of mind. 
                Words emanating from ancient chaos, urging me to rush forward, urging me to jump, urging me to become one with the portal. 
                My body starts to move me. The urge to reach out and open a shimmering <span><a class = "door" id="3" href="./doors/door3.html">door</a></span>, consumes my every instinct. 
                I stop myself, hand grasping handle. A dull, silver, circular, <span><a class = "door" id="4" href="./doors/door4.html">door</a></span> knob, graces my hand. 
                It saved me from jumping. The cool metal shock rips through my body, changing the shouting chorus into a tickle in the back of my mind. 
                If not for the memory of the shouting, I would pay no attention to it. 
                A grand, ornate <span><a class = "door" id="5" href="./doors/door5.html">door</a></span> appears and the knob slips out of my grasp as the door fades to its next destination. 
                I brace for the chaos but nothing comes. 
                As I open my eyes, the portal has stilled, the <span><a class = "door" id="6" href="./doors/door6.html">doors</a></span> remaining for longer, waiting to be opened. 
                I begin to walk towards one, ready to see what's on the other side. 
                I wonder if it will be a path out. 
                I wonder if the primal echo was a voice to be feared or loved.
                I wonder how to choose.
                I close my eyes and reach out. A cool sensation washes over me, as my hand grasps a handle. 
                I ready myself to open the <span><a class = "door" id="7" href="./doors/door7.html">door</a></span>. 
                My worry washes away as I turn the handle and open the <span><a class = "door" id="8" href="./doors/door8.html">door</a></span>. 
                A wash of air tumbles over my skin, and I take my first stepâ€¦
